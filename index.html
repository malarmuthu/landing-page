                        Yosemite has many trials, I personally loved hiking Taft point.
                        Its a breath taking view from here. It's a short doable hike. There is half Dome hike
                        which has some amazing views and a very streous hike. We also did the vernal falls hike.

                        There is no one who would not love to watch the beautiful grand canyon.
                        Its huge and beautiful. We did not hike much here. There are many trials which even includes
                        overnight camping. We did smaller easier hikes, as we had to cover anteloppe canyons during our visit.                    </p>

                        Rocky Mountains is breath taking, has some amazing views and very strenous hikes.
                        If you are an avid hikers, take all necessary precautions before heading here.
                        Enjoy some breath taking views. We did Emerald Lake and Dream Lake trials.

                        Smoky Mountains is one of the most visited National parks in the East.
                        There are many trials to choose and pick the one of your pace. 
                        I have personally enjoyed Alum Cave trials which leads to Mt LaConte.It's a very strenous hike with some
                        amazing views.
